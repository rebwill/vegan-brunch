Well thanks to the miracle of gooey soaked chia seeds and hot oil on a griddle, we can have our French toast and not eat eggs too. Get the toasting right and you'll be pleasantly surprised by the moist middle and crispy outside."

    "description": "We recommend bringing this heavenly cream to your most vegan-hating family gatherings and soaking in the ooh's and ahh's from your uncle with the cholesterol-hardened arteries before announcing that it is a 100% card-carrying vegan recipe. The best part is that it's incredibly easy to make — if you don't have a mixer, you can just use a whisk. If you don't have a whisk, you can use a fork. If you don't have a fork, maybe work on solving that first. You have bigger problems."

Nutritional yeast for that savory, cheesy, nutty flavor, but without dairy or eggs!"

The key to this dessert is to let it sit overnight and let the tofu really marinate in the chocolateyness. You will not believe what is going to happen in your mouth after that. Pro tip: put it on pancakes with strawberries or raspberries. If you really want to blow your guests' minds and send them into an actual medical sugar coma, combine with coconut whipped cream. Caution: this might be illegal?"
