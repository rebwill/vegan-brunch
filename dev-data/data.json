The best part is that it's incredibly easy to make ‚Äî if you don't have a mixer, you can just use a whisk. If you don't have a whisk, you can use a fork. If you don't have a fork, maybe work on solving that first. You have bigger problems."

Tofu's whole thing is that it takes the flavor of whatever you cook/mix it with. The key to this dessert is to let it sit overnight and let the tofu really marinate in the chocolateyness. You will not believe what is going to happen in your mouth after that. Pro tip: put it on pancakes with strawberries or raspberries. If you really want to blow your guests' minds and send them into an actual medical sugar coma, combine with coconut whipped cream. Caution: this might be illegal?"
